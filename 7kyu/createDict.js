// There are two lists, possibly of different lengths. The first one consists of keys,
// the second one consists of values. Write a function createDict(keys, values)
// that returns a dictionary created from keys and values. If there are not enough values,
// the rest of keys should have a None (JS null)value. If there not enough keys, just ignore the rest of values.
